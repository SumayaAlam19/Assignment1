Development Log
day 1
Wrote the statement of purpose and scope.
wrote the features
I am working on my code now. I have done the part of displaying all the packages and the part of selecting packages.
I will be working on feature selecting "date and time. "
Used gem (colorize)

day 2 
Tried to add some more features as selecting time and date. Discussed about this with senior dev and we decided not to add any new things at this point. so for now the features will be selecting packages,displaying packages, making a booking and having the  total price.

day 3 
Starting with testing.
Will split the Software_Development_plan(for_me file for now) file to make it work with test file. 
Sorted out one testing method and working on another.
All the methods of the code are not eligible for testing and as we need to do at least 2 testing I talked with senior dev.
So I have to make another method which will show up a receipt for customer.

18/11/2019
Created a method and created a File.write for the receipt.
