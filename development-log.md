Development Log
14/11/2019
First I wrote the statement of purpose and scope where I mentioned about what the application will do, what will be the main features, who will be the target audience and what type of problem this application may solve.
First I added the features which were Display packages, Select packages, Display the time and date and Display the summary of booking.
Started working on my code which started with a package class. Then made new objects of the class where I used some arrays. To display the the whole package I made a method called "display_all_packages" and to select packages  or display or exit I used tty-prompt gem. Also I used gem "colorize".
I will be working on feature "selecting date and time " and on feature "Display the summary of booking".
Also added some task on trello to follow.

Tried to add some more features as selecting time and date. Discussed about this with senior dev and we decided not to add any new things at this point as I have a lot more to do with my assignment. So for now the features will be selecting packages,displaying packages, making a booking and having the  total price.

Starting with testing.
Will split the Software_Development_plan(for_me file for now) file to make it work with test file. 
Sorted out one testing method and working on another.
All the methods of the code are not eligible for testing and as we need to do at least 2 testing I talked with senior dev.
So I have to make another method which will show up a receipt for customer.
