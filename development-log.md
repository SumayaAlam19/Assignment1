Hi Rachael/Alan
Emailing my first status update. Please let me know if there is any other queries.
**14/11/2019**
**Morning:**
First I wrote the statement of purpose and scope where I mentioned about what the application will do, what will be the main features, who will be the target audience and what type of problem this application may solve.
First I added the features which were Display packages, Select packages, Display the time and date and Display the summary of booking.
**Afternoon:**
Started working on my code which started with a package class. Then made new objects of the class where I used some arrays. To display the the whole package I made a method called "display_all_packages" and to select packages  or display or exit I used tty-prompt gem. Also I used gem "colorize".
I will be working on feature "selecting date and time " and on feature "Display the summary of booking".
Also added some task on trello to follow.
**15/11/2019** 
Tried to work on features as selecting time and date. Discussed about this with senior dev and we decided not to add any new things at this point as I have a lot more to do with my assignment. So for now the features will be selecting packages,displaying packages, making a booking and having the total price.



#### Status update two:
Hi Rachael/Alan
Emailing my second status update. Please let me know if there is any other queries.

**16/11/2019-** 
**Morning:**
Working on spliting SA_PHOTOGRAPHY.rb file to make it work with test file. So created SA_PHOTOGRAPHY_clss.rb file to put class and related methods to work with SA_PHOTOGRAPHY_test.rb file.
Tried out the first testing method which is "test_signature_package" and working on another.
**Afternoon:**
Most of the methods of the code are not suitable for testing and as we need to do at least 2 testing I talked with senior dev.
Now I have to make another method which will show up a receipt for customer.And so made another testing method which is "test_writing_receipt". (Created a File.write for the receipt)
