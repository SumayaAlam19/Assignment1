#SA PHOTOGRAPHY
## Statement of Purpose and Scope
**What this app will do**
The app I want to represent is about capturing moments of your life. It can be either by taking pictures or by taking videos. This app will allow you to book a session for different types of photo shoots and will let you know about the costs.This app will show the date and time available for photo shoot and the user will be able to select date and time at their convenience.

**Makes difficulties easier**
This app can be a solution of different types of problem for both the interprenure and the customer. 

If you see from the view of point of the interprenure, it is way easier to update information on this app. As example you can see that you do not need to go to different places and advertise your work which is less time consuming and cost effective.

If you see from the view of point of a customer, it is so frustrating if you have no ideas of what type of packages do photography companies offer. So in this app we tried to put packages as simple as possible so that the customer can understand and book their desire sessions. Also customer can see our contact details so that if they have any queries they can just simply ask over the phone and email.Also customers have 24/7 access to this app to choose their options. Last but not the least, it is less time consuming and cost effective for customers as well.

**Target Audience**
Another good thing about this app is that you have a vast variety of audience. It could be a couple who is going to get married, it could be an anniversary or birthday party, it could be a new born baby! So you can see your audience could be of any age or from any profession or background.

## Features
There are some features I want to share here which are as below  
1. Display packages. 
2. Select packages.
3. Making a booking.display summ of book

####Display packages: 
User can display packages from the given options. They can see the names and prices of all packages. User will see multiple options in each packages. 
For this feature I have used method called "display_all_packages" which created a concept of variable scope. Used the each loop. So this method will loop over all the packages and will show all the options of the packages. Used variable containing string.

####Select packages:
In this section user will be told to select a number to choose their package of photography. Then they will just have to type the number and select one.
For this feature I have used method called "adding" and used the each_with_index loop. In method its creating a concept of variable scope. I used case as conditional control structure. 

####Making a booking:I this app user can make a booking. To make a booking user can select one or more packages and book them together. I used a method called "printed_receipt" which comes up with the name of the packages the user selected and also shows the total price of the packages.
